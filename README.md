# smooth mandelbrot
The Mandelbrot set using the Escape Time algorithm, and smooth coloring. 1k iterations is ~1.3 seconds on a 800x600 window on a chromebook.
I stole the smooth coloring algorithm from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set.
uses GL/glut.h=
`g++ mandel.cpp -o mandel -lGL -lGLU -lglut -Ofast` to compile on linux. requires `freeglut3`.

multithreading for some reason only slows stuff down (using omp.h), so not doing that.

# Controls:
Drag to move.

Q/E to zoom in/out.

-/= to change the maximum amount of iterations.

1 for Mandelbrot set.

2 for Burning Ship.

3 for Tricorn/mandelbar

4 for weird line fractal with spider web julia sets

5 for Failed MÃ¶bius/Depressed mandelbrot

F goes into fullscreen

R resets.

J for julia set at the point where your cursor is.

SPACE prints position + zoom

B to toggle biomorphs

S to toggle smooth coloring

[&] to in/decrease biomorph value
o&p to in/decrease bailout
# planned stuff
general optimizations, like
boundry tracing? (any help really appreciated)
better controls
# me complaining
I am a total C++ noob, so do not expect much. I do not know anything about glut, I used tutorials.
# Screenshots
here are some epik screenshots using only this program (and the KDE screenshot thing)

I find this one interesting, with a lower bailout value + smooth colors, we get this pretty cool image of a Julia set of the Mandelbrot set.
